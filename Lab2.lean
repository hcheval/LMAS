  `Prop` is the type of propositions. 
  Examples of propositions are equalities, like the ones we've seen in Lab1. 
-/
#check Prop 
#check 5 = 3

/-
  A proposition is itself a type. If `p : Prop`, we can speak of terms `h` of type `p`.
  We interpret some `h : p` as a *proof* of `p`, so we can say that `p` is the type of all its proofs.
  Proving a proposition `p` therefore means providing some term of type `p`.
  For instance, `rfl` from Lab1 is such term of type `x = x`, and therefore a proof that `x = x`.

  Lean defines the usual propositional constructors: conjunction, disjunction, negation.
  Each of them is governed by so-called principles of *introduction* and *elimination*.
  The introduction principle answers the question:
  *how can one, in general, prove a conjunction / disjunction?*,
  while the elimination principle refers to 
  *how can one prove something from a conjunction / disjunction?*

/-
  Using `variable`, we can consider in this section two arbitrary propositions `p` and `q`,
  as if we said *let p and q be any propositions*.

variable (p q : Prop)

  ## And 
  The notation `p ∧ q` is used for `And p q`. 
-/
#print And 
#check And p q
#check @And.intro 
#check @And.left 
#check @And.right 

/-
  ## Or
  The notation `p ∨ q` is used ofr `Or p q`.
-/
#check Or 
#check Or p q
#check @Or.inl 
#check @Or.inr 
#check @Or.elim

/-
  #False
-/
#print False 
#check @False.elim

  ## Not
  Negation is defined by `Not p := p → False`.

  Exercise 1: Prove the following theorem.
  Hint: Look at the `applyFunction` function defined in Lab1
-/
theorem modus_ponens : p → (p → q) → q := sorry

/-
  Exercise 2: Prove the following theorem.
  Hint: Look at the `swap` function defined in Lab1
-/
theorem and_comm : p ∧ q → q ∧ p := sorry


/-
  In principle, any theorem can be proved by simply writing a function of the appropriate type 
  (the type of the theorem's statement), like above.
  This can get unwieldy for complex proofs, so Lean offers a different embedded language called *tactic mode*.
  At any point in a proof, there is a *proof state* composed of a number of hypotheses and a number of goals needing to be proved.
  A tactic changes the proof state, until no more goals are left.
-/

theorem modus_ponens_tactics : p → (p → q) → q := by --we enter tactic mode with `by`. Note the infoview on the right.
  -- we need to prove an implication. We first suppose its premise.
  intros hp -- suppose a proof of `p → q` exists, and call it `h_imp_q`
            -- note the change in the proof state
  -- we still have an implication to prove, so we again assume its premise.
  intros hpq 
  -- we need to prove `q`. We can obtain `q` from the conclusion of `hpq` if we provide the right premise to it
  apply hpq -- the goal would follow from `hpq` if we proved its required conclusion. Note the goal change
  -- the goal is now just an assumption 
  assumption

theorem and_comm_tactics : p ∧ q → q ∧ p := by --we enter tactic mode with `by`. Note the infoview on the right.
  -- we need to prove an implication. We first suppose its premise 
  intros hpq -- suppose a proof of `p wedge q` exists, and call it `hpq`
             -- note the change in the proof state 
  -- we know p ∧ q, and from it can obtain both `p` and `q` by 
  cases hpq with | intro hp hq => 
  -- we need to prove `q ∧ p`. We know this can be proved from `And.intro` 
  apply And.intro 
  -- in order to apply `And.intro` we need to to have both a proof of `p` and a proof of `q`
  -- Lean produced two new goals, both of which are trivial two solve
  case left => assumption 
  case right => assumption 
  

/-
  Usually, tactic mode and term mode may be freely combined.
  For instance, a more concise version of the above may be:
-/
theorem and_comm_tactics' : p ∧ q → q ∧ p := by 
  intros hpq 
  cases hpq with | intro hp hq =>
  exact And.intro hq hp

/-
  Exercise 3: Prove the following theorem, using tactic mode
-/
example : p → q → (p ∧ q) := sorry


/-
  Exercise 4: Give the shortest possible *term mode* proof you can think of for the above statement
-/
example : p → q → (p ∧ q) := sorry 


/-
  Disjunction can be eliminated by pattern matching. 
  A proof of `p ∨ q` is, by definition, either a proof of `p` or a proof `q`.
  Dually, in order to prove `p ∨ q`, one chooses only one of the disjuncts and provides a proof for it. 
-/
example : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := 
  fun h => match h with 
  | Or.inl hp => Or.inr hp 
  | Or.inr hq => Or.inl hq 

example : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by 
  intros h 
  cases h with 
  | inl hp => 
    exact Or.inr hp 
  | inr hp => 
    exact Or.inl hp
